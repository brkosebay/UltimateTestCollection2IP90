    3. (line numbers, explanations of error, and repairments)
	a.
	At line 2 it says:
		if(s=="") {
	this is incorrect, as you can't compare 
	strings using ==, to fix this write: 
		if(s.equals("")) {

	b.
	At line 5 it says:
		return s.substring(s.length-1,s.length)
	this is incorrect, as you can't use .length with strings,
	instead you use .length(), so to fix this write:
		return s.substring(s.length()-1,s.length())
